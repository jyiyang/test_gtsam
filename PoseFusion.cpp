// We will use Pose3 variables to represent the robot positions
#include <gtsam/geometry/Pose3.h>

// We will use simple integer Keys to refer to the robot poses.
#include <gtsam/inference/Key.h>

// As in OdometryExample.cpp, we use a BetweenFactor to model odometry measurements.
#include <gtsam/slam/BetweenFactor.h>

// We add all facors to a Nonlinear Factor Graph, as our factors are nonlinear.
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/NonlinearFactorGraph.h>

// The nonlinear solvers within GTSAM are iterative solvers, meaning they linearize the
// nonlinear functions around an initial linearization point, then solve the linear system
// to update the linearization point. This happens repeatedly until the solver converges
// to a consistent set of variable values. This requires us to specify an initial guess
// for each variable, held in a Values container.
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/Values.h>
// Finally, once all of the factors have been added to our factor graph, we will want to
// solve/optimize to graph to find the best (Maximum A Posteriori) set of variable values.
// GTSAM includes several nonlinear optimizers to perform this step. Here we will use the
// standard Levenberg-Marquardt solver
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/LevenbergMarquardtOptimizer.h>

// Once the optimized values have been calculated, we can also calculate the marginal covariance
// of desired variables
#include <gtsam/nonlinear/Marginals.h>
